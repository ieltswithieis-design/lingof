# IELTS Mastery & International Testing Database

Welcome to the decoupled database directory for the **Lingofi IELTS Official Testing System**.

This folder contains all persistent test assets, question banks, candidate user credentials, and evaluation history. It is completely isolated from the frontend and backend UI application logic so you can easily take the database, backup, modify, inspect, or enrich it with additional tests without modifying application source code!

## How to Upload Texts / Tests in the Database

You can upload new tests in two ways:

### 1. Via the Frontend "Database Studio / Test Uploader"
1. Log in as an Admin or Teacher (or click **"Database & Test Uploader"** in the top navigation).
2. Choose **Text / Markdown Paste** or **JSON Import**.
3. Paste your passage text and formatted questions (or click **"Load Template"** to auto-fill an example).
4. Click **"Verify & Upload to Database"**.
5. The test is instantly written to `database/tests/ielts_database.json` and immediately available in the frontend for candidates to take!

### 2. Via the Backend REST API
Send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/tests/upload` with:
- `Content-Type: application/json`
- Body containing either the structured text in `textPayload` or the structured JSON object.

Example cURL:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/tests/upload \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "section": "reading",
    "title": "Academic Reading: Marine Ecosystems",
    "passages": ["Passage text goes here..."],
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "q": "What is the primary subject?",
        "options": ["Oceans", "Forests", "Cities", "Deserts"],
        "answer": 0
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Backing Up & Improving the Database
- Because everything in `database/` is clean JSON/text, you can open `database/tests/ielts_database.json` in any text editor, add more passages, improve questions, adjust answer keys, or duplicate sets.
- Any changes made to the database files will be served live by the backend API.
