At the time, leading geophysicists rejected Wegener's hypothesis because he could not provide a plausible physical mechanism capable of propelling continental landmasses through the dense oceanic crust.

            questionNumber: 3,
            type: "multiple-choice-single",
            prompt: "Based on the experiment data, as the temperature of the water bath was raised from 20°C to 60°C, the rate of enzyme catalase reaction doubled every 10°C, but at 75°C the reaction rate dropped abruptly to zero. Which biological phenomenon best accounts for the collapse in activity at 75°C?",
            options: [
              "Substrate concentration was depleted exponentially.",
              "The enzyme catalase underwent thermal denaturation of its tertiary active site.",
              "The activation energy of hydrogen peroxide decreased below zero.",
              "Water molecules vaporized completely into ambient steam."
            ],
            correctAnswer: "The enzyme catalase underwent thermal denaturation of its tertiary active site.",
            explanation: "Proteins and enzymes unfold (denature) at excessive temperatures, altering their tertiary catalytic conformation so substrates can no longer bind.",
